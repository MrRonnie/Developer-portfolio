          mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
          Development Hero

            needed to make a website function, efficient. I didn't stop with the
            web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue
            JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you
            100% web solution so don't you worry just contract me.

            First time they though I was not good enough for there company. They
            didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer.
            I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And
            uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
